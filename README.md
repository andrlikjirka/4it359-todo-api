It's completely fine to wait for the next class and ask if there is anything unclear. There is no weakly dead-line so you can postpone and implement any exercise a week later.

# exercises - fork before use!

This repository keeps all exercises, however, you aren't supposed to change it directly.

Before implementing any exercise, please ensure to fork this repository to this group, following this pattern:

```
https://gitlab.com/FIS-VSE/4IT359/exercises-{your insis alias}
```

For example: `https://gitlab.com/FIS-VSE/4IT359/exercises-ruzj16` would work for my alias.

# weekly branches

There will be one new branch each week except the last week. 
The branch will be called `week{week number}` (for example, the first week there will be a branch called `week01`). 
There will be three main parts in each weekly branch:

1. slides from related class
2. exercise desctiption in readme.md file
3. other files related to the exercise

# Implementing an exercise

Exercises are implemented in your fork, not in the main repository.
1. pull changes from the main repository to see the weekly branch you want to implement
2. checkout the weekly branch
3. read the readme.md in the weekly branch
4. create a branch for your implementation
5. implement the exercise using one or more commits
6. push your commits
7. create a pull request to merge the branch into the weekly branch
8. let others to review the PR and approve it (you may ask someone if noone does it on his own)
9. merge the PR to the weekly branch
